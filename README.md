# Project-Skyline
This is a scrapped application I was developing that was a complete rewrite of iDelay Messages. 
After realizing that there was no market for such an application, it was cancelled and made open-source.

**Note:** All of the artwork and assets here are NOT to be duplicated / used without modification / permission. I hold the
copyright to these images and am only open-sourcing this repository to help others gain experience / help
with any similar idea. 

**TLDR; don't steal assets you didn't create.**
